/**
 * IMO 2019 Problem 2 (challenge / stress test).
 *
 * Triangle ABC; A1 on BC, B1 on CA. P on AA1, Q on BB1 with PQ ∥ AB. P1 on ray
 * PB1 beyond B1 with ∠PP1C = ∠BAC; Q1 on ray QA1 beyond A1 with ∠CQ1Q = ∠CBA.
 * Prove P1, Q1, P, Q are concyclic.
 *
 * Auxiliary points A2 = QA1 ∩ AC and B2 = PB1 ∩ BC are pre-drawn so the learner
 * can invoke Pappus.
 *
 * Reference solution (kept for the future hint system):
 *   • Let P2, Q2 be the second meets of B1P and A1Q (with the circle); the angle
 *     conditions are equivalent to P2AP1C and Q2BQ1C concyclic.
 *   • PQP1Q1 concyclic ⇔ P1Q1P2Q2 concyclic (Reim), or by the two angles.
 *   • Pappus on (P,A1,A) and (B,B1,Q): PB1∩BA1 = B2, PQ∩AB = ∞ (PQ∥AB),
 *     A1Q∩B1A = A2 ⇒ A2B2 ∥ AB.
 *   • Then A2B2∥AB ⇒ ∠A2B2C = ∠CQ1A2 = ∠CBA ⇒ CQ1B2A2 concyclic (and likewise
 *     CP1B2A2), which chains to PQP1Q1 concyclic.
